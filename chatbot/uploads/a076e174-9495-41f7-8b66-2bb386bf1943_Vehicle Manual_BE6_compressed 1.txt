1.2 INGLO Platform
INGLO
is
an
‘electric-origin’
Architecture.
Unlike
many
mainstream EVs adapted from traditional combustion-
engine designs, INGLO was built exclusively for electric
vehicles. This difference fundamentally changes the way the
vehicle performs and feels.
INGLO
was
designed
with
modularity,
scalability,
and
versatility.
This electric-origin approach also enables us to design one
of the lightest skateboard structures in the industry, paired
with high-density battery technology. This foundation allows
us to optimize every inch of space, enhance stability, and
maximize performance, which means you, our customers,
will experience a drive that is lighter, more agile, and yet
incredibly spacious and comfortable.
1.3 Vehicle Power and Charging Information
Your BE 6 is equipped with a high-voltage (HV) battery pack,
approximately 409 V/307 V, which powers the vehicle. The
vehicle must be charged before driving, as the battery
stores energy needed for operation.
Once the ignition is turned ON, the battery begins to
discharge gradually. If the battery charge is depleted
completely (0%), the vehicle will not be able to drive until the
battery is recharged.
Charging times may vary based on the current state of
charge (SOC) of the battery and environmental conditions.
For detailed information on how to charge the battery,
please refer to the "Charging" section.
Your vehicle features an Integrated Electronic Booster with
ABS and ESP, along with regenerative braking for added
efficiency.
Your
vehicle
is
eco-friendly
and
produces
no
toxic
emissions, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or
nitrogen oxide.
Since the electric motor is quiet, you may hear sounds from
the tires, wind, and other external sources. During charging,
you might also hear noises from the fan, compressor,
contactor, and relay.
General And Safety Information
1-4
© Copyright Mahindra Electric Automobile Ltd. 022025
Always check and ensure enough SOC is available in the HV
battery before starting the journey. Verify the same with the
help of "State of charge (SOC)" & "Range" values displayed
in the Driver Information Display (DID).
Pay special attention to the pedestrians since there is no
engine noise. The pedestrian may not know that the vehicle
is approaching or moving or about to move, and can step
into the path of vehicle travel.
Virtual Engine Sound Simulators (VESS) available in the
vehicle can be enabled for more safety. Refer “Virtual Engine
Sound Simulators (VESS)” content for more details.
For preventing damage to the HV battery pack:
•
Never allow the HV battery to be fully discharged.
•
Discharging the HV battery to 0% may cause damage to
vehicle components. Persistent deep discharges can
cause permanent battery degradation.
•
Do not leave the vehicle at 100% SOC for prolonged
periods, as it may reduce battery longevity.
•
Always charge in a well- ventilated area, away from
flammable materials.
•
Do not use the Battery as a stationary power source. This
will void the warranty.
•
Do not expose the vehicle to very high or freezing
temperatures for longer duration.
•
Do not use High-Voltage (HV) battery for any other
purpose, consult your Mahindra Authorised Dealer or
manufacturer for help.
If you let the battery discharge to 0%, other components
may be damaged or need to be replaced (Ex., Low voltage
battery).
In
these
cases,
you
are
liable
for
repair
and/or
transportation costs.
The warranty does not cover discharge-related expenses.
BE 6 uses high voltage and current. Failure to follow the
proper handling instructions may cause serious injury or
death.
BE 6 cannot be push started or tow-started. Attempting to
do so may cause internal power train/ motor damage.
BE 6 uses high voltage systems, these systems may be hot
during charging & driving, also sometimes in shut off
condition. Be careful of both the high voltage and the high

•
Strictly do not allow untrained / non designated people
to access EV system and appraise first responders that
this vehicle is an Electric Vehicle, in case of any kind of
unexpected incident/ events
•
The vehicle will not run with completely discharged
battery. At low SOC avoid continuous & (frequent
acceleration and deceleration) this will result in higher
energy consumption. Try to maintain a steady speed with
moderate
acceleration
for
getting
the
maximum
efficiency.
•
Driving in down gradient, when accelerator pedal is
released, regenerative braking will provide some energy
to recharge battery pack and simultaneously assists in
deceleration.
•
You may hear some sounds and feel vibrations during
the drive this is normal;
–
Traction
motor
makes
lighter
sound
during
its
operation, also will be higher in deceleration of
vehicle.
–
HV contactor makes “tak” noise when vehicle is
switched ON/OFF
–
AC compressor makes sound while in operation
•
If the ambient temperature is between –10 °C to 0 °C,
there will be a considerable increase in charging time,
also performance drop during drive
•
The Performance of battery will decrease with time and
usage. This does not indicate any defect in the battery
pack.
General And Safety Information

Protecting Our Environment: As responsible citizens, all of
us have an important role to play in protecting our
environment.
Judicious
vehicle
usage
and
ensuring
hazardous
waste
disposal
(including
cleaning
and
lubrication fluids) are important steps towards this initiative.
Body Repairs: In the event of a collision involving an electric
vehicle, safety is paramount. Avoid contact with high voltage
cables (orange colored), damaged battery components or
leaking fluids, as these can be toxic or conductive.
Be aware that airbags may deploy even after the vehicle is
stationary,
and
high-voltage
battery
is
automatically
disconnected in severe collisions to reduce risks. Occupants
should exit the vehicle immediately if it is safe to do so and
move to a safe distance, avoiding re-entry unless absolutely
necessary.
After the collision, notify Roadside Assistance that an
electric vehicle is involved, and do not attempt to charge the
vehicle until it has been inspected by a qualified Mahindra
technician.
Only a flatbed is allowed for towing to prevent further
damage, and have the vehicle towed to a Mahindra
Authorised Dealer.
1.11 Disclaimers
1.11.1 Event Data Recorder (EDR)
Note: EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a non-
trivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR
under normal driving conditions and no personal data (for

is
recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement,
could combine the EDR data with person identifying data
they routinely acquire during a crash investigation.
1.11.2 Vehicle Telematics

4 Seats and Safety
4.1 Important Safety Precautions
Always wear your seat belt
All occupants, including the driver, should always wear their
seat belt no matter how short the trip is, in order to
minimize the risk of severe injury in the event of a crash.
Failure to wear a seat belt significantly increases the risk of
serious injury or fatality in an accident.
In an accident, an unbelted passenger can be projectiled,
and
can
cause
serious
injury
to
himself
or
another
passenger.
Pregnant
women
must
also
wear
seat
belts
after
consultation with the doctor for specific recommendations.
Airbag Hazards
Airbags are critical safety devices, but they can lead to
hazards if mishandled or improperly used. Airbags are
supplementary safety systems and are not a substitute for
seat belts. Rapid deployment with significant force can
cause injuries, especially to occupants seated too close,
unbelted, or improperly positioned, including children and
shorter adults.
Chemical exposure from deployment residues can irritate
the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. To minimize hazards,
always use seat belts, maintain proper seating positions,
deactivate
airbags
during
servicing,
and
follow
safety
protocols. Never place a rear-facing child seat in the front
passenger seat unless the airbag is deactivated. Doing so
can result in serious injury or death if the airbag deploys.
Driver distraction
Driver
distraction
occurs
when
a
driver’s
attention
is
diverted from the primary task of operating the vehicle,
compromising safety. Driver distraction can lead to loss of
vehicle control, collisions, serious injury, or death. It can
stem from visual distractions like looking at a phone,
manual distractions such as adjusting controls, or cognitive
distractions like daydreaming or conversing.
Common sources include mobile devices, infotainment
systems, eating, and external events. Distracted driving
increases the risk of accidents, as reaction times slow and
situational awareness diminishes. To mitigate this risk,
drivers should minimize in-vehicle distractions, use hands-
free devices sparingly, and maintain focus on the road to
ensure their safety and that of others.
Mahindra is not liable for accidents resulting from driver
distraction or failure to follow safe driving practices.
Seats and Safety
4-2
© Copyright Mahindra Electric Automobile Ltd. 022025
Control your speed
Controlling your speed is essential for safe driving, as
excessive speed reduces reaction time, increases stopping
distance, and magnifies the severity of collisions. Adhering
to speed limits ensures better vehicle control, especially in
adverse weather, heavy traffic, or around curves and
intersections.
Always adhere to posted speed limits and adjust speed
based on weather, road conditions, and traffic flow. Driving
at a safe and appropriate speed helps accommodate
unexpected hazards, such as pedestrians or sudden stops,
and improves fuel efficiency. Always adjust your speed
based on road conditions, visibility, and traffic flow to
protect yourself, passengers, and others on the road.
Mahindra shall not be liable / responsible for any damages /
injuries,
including
consequential
damages
/
injuries,

ISOFIX system is a standardized method of fitting child seats
that eliminates the need to use the standard adult Seat belt
to secure the seat in the vehicle. This enables a more secure
and positive location with the added benefit of easier and
quicker installation.
•
When using the “ISOFIX” lower latch system (rod), all
unused vehicle rear seat belt metal latch plates or tabs
must be latched securely in their seat belt buckles and
the seat belt webbing must be retracted behind the child
restraint to prevent the child from reaching and taking
hold of un-retracted seat belts. Unlatched metal latch
plates or tabs may allow the child to reach the un-
retracted seat belts which may result in strangulation
and a serious injury or death to the child in the child
restraint.
•
Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand
only
those
loads
imposed
by
correctly-fitted
child
restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used
for adult seat belts, harnesses or for attaching other
items or equipment to the vehicle
How to use the Top Tether/Rear Anchor
There are two top tether
rods/rear anchors on the
seat base back side of the
rear row front facing seats.
1.
Remove
the
headrest
from the rear row seat
2. Place the child restraint
on the rear row seat
3. Connect the tether connector in child restraint to the top
tether rod/ rear anchor. Securely tighten the child restraint
by adjusting the webbing of the child restraint system (CRS)
tether connector. Follow the clear instructions provided in
the CRS manual
•
The top-tether/ rear anchor is the supplemental device to
secure the child restraint system after engaging it by the
ISOFIX rod/lower latches. Therefore, do not secure the
child restraint system only with the seat back anchors.
The increased load may cause the hooks or anchors to
break, causing serious injury or death.
•
If a child restraint is not properly secured to the vehicle
and a child is not properly restrained in the child
Seats and Safety

restraint, the child could be seriously injured or killed in
a collision. Always follow the instructions provided by the
child restraint manufacturer for installation
•
Make sure the latches of the child restraint system are
Firmly latched to the ISOFIX rod/lower latches. In this
case, you can hear the “click” sound/ latch indications
provided on seat.
•
Incorrectly installed child restraint system may cause an
unexpected personal injury. Additionally, a loose or
improperly fitted child seat may not provide adequate
protection.
•
Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand
only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child
restraints and must never be used to secure other
objects, equipment, or adult passengers. Misuse may
cause serious injury or death.
•
The tether strap may not work properly if attached
somewhere other than the correct top tether rod/rear
anchor provided on seat back.
•
Don’t put the top tether strap over the head restraint of
rear row seat which is not the correct method and may
cause risk.
•
Rock the child restraint to check if it is securely installed.
Refer to instructions provided by the manufacturer of the
child restraint.
•
Do not install the child restraint of such size if it hinders
the operations of the front seat and causes problems to
the front occupants.
•
Never place a rear-facing child restraint in the front
passenger seat unless the airbag is deactivated. Airbag
deployment can cause serious injury or death to a child.

Cautions for ISOFIX Seat usage
•
The anchor provided on rear seat base back is the
supplemental device to secure the child restraint system
after engaging it by the lower latches. Therefore, do not
secure the child restraint system only with the seat back
anchors. The increased load may cause the hooks or
anchors to break, causing serious injury or death.
•
If a child restraint is not properly secured to the vehicle
and a child is not properly restrained in the child
restraint, the child could be seriously injured or killed in a
collision. Always follow the instructions provided by the
manufacturer for installation.
•
Make sure the latches of the child restraint system are
latched to the lower latches. In this case, you can hear
the “click” sound and color indications.
•
The child restraint seat strap may not work properly if
attached somewhere other than the correct seat back
anchor provided on the rear seat base back side behind
the seat carpet. Follow the instructions provided on the
seat back for the details of the anchor location.
•
Make sure that the child restraint system is firmly
secured by rocking it in different directions.
•
Incorrectly installed child restraint system may cause an
unexpected personal injury.

4.3.1 Airbag Deployment
The images shown in this section are for illustrative purpose
only. They may not look like your model/variant or vehicle.
Front Airbag
Front airbag are designed
to
inflate
in
a
frontal
collision depending on the
intensity, speed or angles of
impact of the front collision.
4.3.2 Airbag Non-deployment
Impacts below a pre-determined threshold level may not
cause the airbag to deploy in the following cases:
Collision with Utility Poles or Trees :
Airbags may not inflate if
the
vehicle
collides
with
objects such as utility poles
or trees, where the point of
impact is concentrated to
one area and the full force
of
the
impact
is
not
delivered to the sensors.
Frontal Impact :
Frontal impact beyond 30º
range from head-on to the
vehicle.

Seats and Safety
4-12
© Copyright Mahindra Electric Automobile Ltd. 022025
Frontal Side Swipe Impact:
Frontal offset impact to the vehicle may not provide the
deceleration force necessary for airbag deployment.
In an angled collision, the
force of impact may direct
the occupants in a direction
where the airbags would
not be able to provide any
additional benefit, and thus
the sensors may not deploy
any airbags.
Under-ride Situations :
Running
under
a
truck's
tailgate
may
not
provide
the decelerations necessary
for airbag deployment.
Airbags will not inflate in
this “under-ride” situation
where deceleration forces
that
are
detected
by
sensors
are
significantly
low.
Rear-end Collisions :
Frontal
airbags
are
not
designed to inflate in rear
collisions, where occupants
are moved backward away
from the airbags by the
force of the impact. In this
case, inflated airbags would
not be able to provide any
additional benefit.
Potholes or Stepped Surfaces :
Driving into a big pothole,
stepped surface or hitting
the far side of a hole/incline
will not inflate the airbag.
Seats and Safety

Rollover:
Airbags will not inflate in
rollover
accidents
where
airbag
deployment
would
not provide protection to
the
occupants.
However,
side
impact
and
curtain
airbags
may
inflate
only
when severe side impact
causes rollover.
Side airbags and side curtain airbags may inflate in a
strong impact.
Side airbags and side curtain airbags may inflate even in a
frontal collision, if there is a strong impact to the lateral
direction.
A
frontal
collision
occurs
when the front ends of two
vehicles collide
When a vehicle hits a curb
or bump
When a vehicle experiences
a hard landing or fall

Side airbags and side curtain airbags may not inflate
In the event of a side impact to the vehicle body, excluding
the passenger compartment, several areas of the vehicle
are typically affected.
When a vehicle is impacted
from the side at an oblique
angle
When a vehicle is impacted
from the side by a high-

4.3.3 Airbag Service
Airbag Replacement: Self-servicing or tampering with the
airbag system is dangerous. An airbag could accidentally
deploy causing serious injuries, or will not deploy when
there is a need. Always take your vehicle to a Mahindra
Authorised Dealer for inspection and repairs.
Removing SRS Related Parts: We do not recommend
removing the instrument panel, steering wheel, seats or
airbag related parts or sensors by any individual or garages
which are not recommended. Airbags could accidentally
activate and cause serious injuries, or they may not deploy
when there is a need. Visit a Mahindra Authorised Dealer if
these parts must be removed.
Airbag Disposal: Improper disposal of an airbag or a
vehicle with live airbags can be extremely dangerous.
Approach a Mahindra Authorised Dealer to do these jobs.
Airbag Repair: If the front airbag cover or instrument panel
airbag cover shows signs of damage or having been
removed, the vehicle should be towed to the nearest
Mahindra Authorised Dealer for repair. Do not attempt to
self repair or reinstall the cover.
Airbag Maintenance: For cleaning the airbag covers/areas,
use only a soft dry cloth or one which has been moistened
with plain water. Solvents or cleaners could adversely affect
the airbag covers and proper deployment of the system.
An airbag is not designed to deploy in every type of crash.
Depending on the type of accident or impact, the front
airbags
independently
deploy
thereby
protecting
the
occupants. It is not necessary that ALL the airbags deploy
during an accident.

6.4.3 Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)
The Anti-lock Brake System (also called as ABS) is designed
to help prevent lock-up of the wheels and stable stopping of
vehicle during a sudden, panic emergency braking or
braking on slippery road surfaces. The ABS system takes
input from wheel speed sensors and brake pedal switch to
control the brake fluid pressures at the wheels to avoid
wheel lock-up. It allows vehicle to be steered during braking.
The minimum speed for ABS to function is 12 kmph. ABS is
activated only during wheel lock conditions where ABS takes
over and prevents wheel lock.
During the ABS operation, a slight pulsation may be felt in
the brake pedal to indicate ABS is active. You may also hear
motor
noise
from
the
motor
compartment.
It
is
recommended to hold the brake pedal firmly while the ABS
is active rather than pumping the brake pedal.
Depressing the brake pedal on slippery road surfaces as on
a manhole cover, a steel plate at a construction site, a joint
in a bridge, etc. on a rainy day, tends to activate the anti-lock
brake system.
The ABS warning lamp lights up when you
switch ON the ignition and should go out after
a few seconds. If the ABS warning lamp does
not go out or if it comes ON while driving, it means there is a
fault in the ABS system. In both cases, the normal braking
system remains efficient, exactly as on a vehicle without
ABS. The vehicle should be examined as soon as possible by
an Mahindra Authorised Dealer.
The ABS is not designed to shorten the stopping distance:
Always drive at a moderate speed and maintain a safe
distance from the vehicle in front of you. The stopping
distance may be longer in the following cases:
•
Driving on rough, gravel or snow-covered roads
•
Driving with tyre chains installed
•
Driving over the steps such as the joints on the road
•
Driving on roads where the road surface is potholes or
large differences in surface height
Do not overestimate the Anti-lock Brake System: Although
the Anti-lock Brake System assists in providing vehicle
control, it is still important to drive with all due care and
maintain a moderate speed and safe distance from the
vehicle in front of you. There are limits to the vehicle
stability and effectiveness of steering wheel operation even
with ABS active.
If tyre grip performance exceeds its capability, or if
hydroplaning occurs during high speed driving in the rain,
the Anti-lock Brake System will not be able to completely
avoid wheel lock-up

6.4.4 Regenerative Braking System
Regenerative braking (Paddle shifter)
A
regenerative
braking
system
is
an
energy recovery
mechanism used in your electric origin vehicles. It captures
and converts the kinetic energy produced during braking
into electrical energy, which is stored in the vehicle's battery
for future use.
The paddle shifter allows you to adjust the regenerative
braking level from 0 to 3 while decelerating.
•
Left side (Regen +): Increases regenerative braking and
enhances deceleration.
•
Right side (Regen —): Decreases regenerative braking
and reduces deceleration.

10 Climate Controls System
HVAC system provided in the vehicle enables occupants to
automatically/manually adjust air flow distribution pattern,
air flow rate, air intake mode and air temperature inside
passenger
Touch screen
By appropriately selecting the options provided on the
HVAC infotainment touchscreen, located on center console,
occupant’s comfort can be ensured.
HVAC system also helps in defogging / de-misting the
windshield and windows. Air flow direction can be further
controlled by adjusting louvres of air vents. An air filter is
provided at the inlet of HVAC blower.
PTC HEATER
PTC HEATER An air PTC heater is utilized to heat the cabin
air. For cooling the cabin air, an air conditioning circuit
based on the vapor compression refrigeration cycle is used.
The air conditioning system uses a refrigerant along with a
suitable lubricating oil.
Although being non-ozone depleting, the refrigerant is a
greenhouse gas, hence once allowed to escape in the
atmosphere,
it
adversely
affects
the
environment
by
contributing to global warming/climate change
Refrigerant used in system is a hazardous liquified gas and
is under high pressure.
The refrigerant is colorless and has ethereal or faint
sweetish odor. Exposure of refrigerant to skin or eyes may
cause irritation and frostbite.
They can also cause suffocation, dizziness and loss of
concentration. When mixed with compressed air or certain
other refrigerants, it may form flammable mixture. Never
try to service HVAC system yourself which would involve
refrigerant handling. Mahindra shall not be liable for any
loss or damage result from such self-servicing. Further, such
self-servicing will void the warranty.
- If you sleep while operating the air conditioner or heater
with all the windows closed, you may suffocate to death due
to lack of ventilation. When you operate the air conditioner
or heater, ventilate frequently.
Multiple vents are provided for distributing the air, being
force-circulated by HVAC blower, throughout the passenger
compartment.

To ensure sufficient air flow and hence adequate HVAC
system performance, air flow path should be kept free of
obstructions. Keep system’s air intake, located near plenum
appliqué, free of snow, leaves and other debris. Also keep
the area in front of air vents free of any obstruction inside
the cabin.
During charging of the vehicle with ignition OFF condition,
sometimes it can be observed that the A/C touch control
panel lights getting ON. This is a normal behavior and
happens since the A/ C compressor is active for battery
cooling. However, cabin A/C will not turn ON unless it is
turned ON by user either through the ICC switch input or
through the app.

11.1 Electric Vehicle
An electric vehicle operates using a battery and an electric
motor. Unlike conventional vehicles, which rely on an
internal combustion engine and gasoline as fuel, electric
vehicles are powered by electrical energy stored in a high-
voltage
battery.
As
a
result,
electric
vehicles
are
environmentally friendly, as they do not require fossil fuels
and produce no exhaust emissions.
Charging and Energy Consumption

Electric vehicle characteristics:
•
EVs are powered by electrical energy stored in a high-
voltage battery, eliminating the need for traditional fuels
like
gasoline.
This
method
significantly
reduces
air
pollution, as there are no exhaust emissions, making EVs
a cleaner, more environmentally friendly transportation
option.
•
EVs are equipped with high-performance motors that
provide
smooth,
efficient
power
delivery.
Unlike
traditional ICE vehicles, EVs produce minimal engine
noise
and
vibrations,
offering
a
quieter
and
more
comfortable driving experience. This contributes to a
more serene ride, with less mechanical noise and less
vibration felt inside the cabin
•
When decelerating or driving downhill, regenerative
braking is utilized to charge the high voltage battery. This
minimizes energy loss and increases the distance to
empty
•
When the battery charge is low, there are several
charging options available:
AC Charging: This is the most common method. It is
slower but convenient for home charging or public
charging stations.
DC Fast Charging: This method uses direct current (DC)
to rapidly charge the battery at high power levels, often
found at fast-charging stations. DC fast charging is ideal
for long trips or quick recharges.
Battery Information:
•
The vehicle is equipped with a high-voltage battery that
powers the motor and systems like the air conditioning,
while
a
separate
12V
auxiliary
battery
powers
components such as the lights, wipers, and audio system.
•
The auxiliary battery is automatically charged when the
vehicle is in the "Ready to Drive" mode or when the high-
voltage battery is being charged

position and tighten the
diagonally
opposite
wheel
bolts
using
the
wheel spanner.
•
Grab the spanner near the end of the handle and push
down on the handle. Be careful that the spanner does
not slip off the bolt. Do not remove the bolts, but loosen
them by one or two turns.
Do not apply force with your legs (or stand) on the wheel
spanner while loosening/tightening the wheel bolts.
Grab the spanner near the end of the handle and push
down on the handle. Be careful that the spanner does not
slip off the bolt. Do not remove the bolts, but loosen them
by one or two turns.
Do not lift alloy rims with aero bezels during handling.
Lifting by the bezels may cause damage to the aero
components and compromise the integrity of the wheel..
Never use oil or grease on the bolts . Doing so may lead to
over tightening of the bolts, wheel spanner slip, damage the
bolts and also may cause personal injuries. Also, bolts may
loosen and the wheels may fall off, which could cause a
serious accident. If there is oil or grease on any bolt, clean
before installing.
Improperly or loosely tightened wheel bolts are dangerous.
The wheel could wobble or come off. This could result in
loss of vehicle control and cause a serious accident. Always
make
sure
all
the
wheel
bolts
are
properly/securely
tightened to the specified torque.
When lowering the vehicle, make sure all portions of your
body are clear off the vehicle as it is lowered to the ground.
Have the wheel bolts tightened with the torque spanner
to140 Nm , as soon as possible after changing wheels.
If you have rotated, repaired, changed your tyres or
changed the wheel rims, check the wheel bolts are still tight
after driving about 1,000 km (Torque 140 Nm).
Put the wheel cap (if equipped) into position aligning the
nozzle on the wheel to the nozzle clearance on the wheel

cover. Tap it firmly on the sides with your hand to snap it
into place.
Check the air pressure of the replaced tyre. If the pressure is
lower than recommended, drive slowly to the nearest
service station and inflate to the correct pressure. If it is too
high, adjust it until it is correct. Always reinstall the valve cap
after checking or adjusting tyre pressure. If the cap is not
replaced, dirt and moisture could get into the valve core and
cause air leakage. If you lose a valve cap, buy another and
instal it as soon as possible.

13.2 Fuses & Relays
A fuse is the most common electric protection device. A fuse
is placed in an electrical circuit, so that when current flow
exceeds the rating of the fuse, it blows off.
The element in the fuse melts, opening the circuit and
preventing other components of the circuit from being
damaged by the over current. The size of the metal fuse
element determines the rating. Once a fuse blows off, it
must be replaced with a new one.
Fuse puller is available at the motor compartment fuse box.
Before handling any fuses, always switch off the ignition,
lights, and all electrical equipment to prevent the risk of
electrical shock or short circuits
Never replace a fuse with one of a different rating, as this
may cause electrical damage or create a fire hazard.
Fuse replacements or electrical repairs should only be
performed by a Mahindra Authorized Service Center or a
qualified workshop. Improper handling may result in
serious damage to the vehicle’s electrical system
